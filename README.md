# Cemu-UI

## To Do
- ~~Last Played~~
- ~~Time Played~~
- ~~Local Settings File~~
- Settings Page
- Favorites
- Search
- Sort by Name/Region/Etc
- Get Cemu version
- Controller Support
- Super Mario Maker Level Browser/Downloader

## ~~Fix directory trees~~

~~Cemu-UI.exe should be in the main directory, everything else in /src/ like this:~~
- ~~/Cemu-UI/Cemu-UI.exe~~
- ~~/Cemu-UI/src/cef/[CEF Dlls]~~
- ~~/Cemu-UI/src/ui.html~~
- ~~/Cemu-UI/src/js/cemu-ui.js~~
- ~~/Cemu-UI/src/meta/[Meta files]~~

~~Would be much cleaner.~~
